 		<h2>Travelling</h2> 

 			<p>
 			 Travelling is for me a way to grow intellectually by discovering new cultures, accepting others and adopting their way of life. Travel is about enjoying cultural diversity and being immersed in the values that inspire us. It is by travelling that we learn to know ourselves better and to be filled with knowledge.

 		<h2>Music</h2> 

 			<p>
 			 I love music and listen to it several hours a day while doing many other activities. I listen to many styles of music ranging from classical music, to rap Us or French rap. African music is also very present in my playlist whether because of my travels in Africa or by the culture in which I was immersed. I also listen to variety, rock, jazz but to a lesser extent.
